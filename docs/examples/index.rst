Examples
========

This page provides a series of examples, tutorials and recipes to help you
get started with ``openpathsampling``.

Each subsection is a notebook.  To open these notebooks in a "live" IPython
session and execute the documentation interactively, you need to download
the repository and start the IPython notebook.

If you installed `openpathsampling` from source, you will need to navigate
to :code:`path-to-openpathsampling/examples`. The notebook files for these
examples and the notebooks are available in the top level

.. code:: bash

   $ jupyter notebook

.. note:: The pre-filled out notebooks are *far* less fun than running them
          yourself!

Introductory Examples
---------------------

These examples give the entire process of a path sampling simulation: going
from an initial frame to a set of initial trajectories, performing the path
sampling, and the analyzing the results.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   mstis
   AD_tps

We recommend beginning with those two examples: they cover most of the
essential points of using OPS. However, we have several other examples which
show how to use these approaches for specific cases. Here are several of
those:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    srtis
    mistis
    AD_fixed_len_tps
    AD_mstis

Note that some of those build off of the earlier examples. If working
through the example notebooks yourself, each notebook in a sequence is
numbered so you know the order to run them.

Advanced Examples
-----------------

The advanced examples demonstrate some of the more specialized uses of OPS. 

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    AD_advanced_analysis
    DNA_flux_example
    custom_movescheme

Special Topics
--------------

In order to illustrate several features of the code, we have also developed
some "special topics" examples. These usually require that you have already
run one of the introductory examples, but demonstrate some optional behavior
you might find interesting.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    restarting
    splitting_files
    customizing_visualization
    storage

Let us know if you would like to contribute other example notebooks, or have
any suggestions for how these can be improved.
