\begin_layout Abstract
The application of small-sized Markov state models (MSMs) has become a standard
 tool for the analysis of the dynamics in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
 and computation of key properties.
 Here we present a rigorous approach to enhance the generation of a MSM
 for a system of biomolecules using multi-state transition interface sampling
 (MSTIS)

\end_inset

In recent years Markov State Models (MSMs) have matured into a useful tool
 for the descriptions of dynamics that shows stochastic, but metastable
 behavior on the timescales of interest

.
 This includes protein dynamics, chemical [cite], physical systems [cite],
 etc.
 Its application spans dynamics that can be written using a differential
 equation that is first order in time and has also been applied for various
 types of dynamics, e.g.
 Brownian dynamics, Langevin dynamics, etc...
 Once a MSM has been succesfully parametrized from data it allows to quickly
 compute a large variety of target properties like relaxation timescales,
 mean first passage times, metastable subsets

 and path related properties like reactive pathways and committor probabilities
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The usage of conditional jump probabilities also allows to effectively
 split the generation of necessary statistics into independent subproblems
 that require only local equilibrium and can be thus be parallelized as
 used in adaptive sampling techniques.

The matrix

 can be interpreted as a list of vectors that contain the expected difference
 in counts between timeseries started from equilibrium and timeseries started

This can be used to compute the expected time to reach a state when started

 & = & 1+\frac{\mA_{kk}^{\#}}{\pi_{k}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also compute the variance in the mean first passage time by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mV_{ij} & = & \text{vmfpt}[i\rightarrow j]=\mathbb{E}_{\vx\mid x_{0}=i}\left[\left(\min_{n\ge1}x_{n}=j-\mM_{ij}\right)^{2}\right]\\
\mV_{ij} & = & \mB_{ij}-\left(\mM_{ij}\right)^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

with the squared fluctuations given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mB=\mM\left(2\mA_{dg}^{\#}\mD+\Id\right)+2\left(\mA^{\#}\mM-\m{J}(\mA^{\#}\mM)_{dg}\right)
\]

\end_inset

which can be simplified for the diagonal elements
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mB_{dg}=2\mD\mA_{dg}^{\#}\mD+\mD
\]

\end_inset

I assume we could use this to check how fast a certain region might be explored
 up to a certain percentage.

Probability to enter a state

 before visiting any other state 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq i$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using OOM we can also change the expression for the committor to trajectories
 of a maximal length which is very useful.
 See Multi-State MFPT for the extension to the distribution for a trajectory
 length 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This directly gives also the probability to not hit any core!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mT_{V}=\diag(\{\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if }i\in\mV\\
0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}\mid i\in\Omega\})\,\mT
\]

\end_inset

which is the the transition matrix with all columns set to zero that belong
 to states that are not in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mV$
\end_inset

 the set of states not in a core, also referred to as the 
\emph on
void
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then split the rank deficient matrix into eigenvalues and left and right
 eigenvectors like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mT_{V}=\mR_{V}\diag(\lambda_{V})\mL_{V}
\]

\end_inset

then the max length committor is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{k}=\mR_{V}\diag(\frac{\lambda_{V}^{len}-1}{\lambda_{V}-1})\mL_{V}\mT_{:,k}
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $len$
\end_inset

 being the maximal length of the trajectory and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the core state selected.
 The probabilities to not reach any core is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{not}=1-\sum_{k}C_{k}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also get the probability to reach a state in exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 states by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{k}(n)=\mR_{V}\diag(\lambda_{V}^{n})\mL_{V}\mT_{:,k}
\]

\end_inset

with this object we can write the committor as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{k}=\sum_{n=0}^{len}p_{k}(n)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multi-state MFPT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Average time to visit a state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 before visiting any other state 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mM=\text{cmfpt}\left[i\rightarrow j\mid\neg V\right]=\mathbb{E}_{\vx\mid x_{0}=i,x_{i}\notin V}\left[\min_{n\ge1}x_{n}=j\right]
\]

\end_inset

Using OOM the expressions can be written down easily.
 I have not yet found a way to reduce the complexity by one order, but it
 works.
 One can also get the distribution of times since OOMs allow to specify
 which type of trajectories should be used, e.g.
 we can ask what is the average time to visit state 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 among all trajectories that do not end up prior in another core state 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and have a maximal length of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{max}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the complete distribution we can also compute higher moments like variances
 of the 
\emph on
mfpt
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
confidence intervals
\emph default
.
 We compute
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
m_{k}(n) & = & C_{k}^{-1}\sum_{n=0}^{len}(1+k)p_{k}(n)\\
 & = & C_{k}^{-1}\mR_{V}\diag(\frac{1-(n+2)\lambda_{V}^{n+1}+(n+1)\lambda_{V}^{n+2}}{(1-\lambda_{V})^{2}})\mL_{V}\mT_{:,k}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which simplifies to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
m_{k}(\infty) & = & C_{k}^{-1}\mR_{V}\diag((1-\lambda_{V})^{-2})\mL_{V}\mT_{:,k}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and in the case, where we have only one core this should reduce to the known
 mfpt as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
m_{k}(\infty) & = & \mR_{V}\diag((1-\lambda_{V})^{-2})\mL_{V}\mT_{:,k}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which provides an alternative to the previously given expressions to compute
 the mfpt.
 Similarly we can derive also variances in the mfpt
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
v_{k}(n) & = & C_{k}^{-1}\sum_{n=0}^{len}(1+k)^{2}p_{k}(n)\\
 & = & C_{k}^{-1}\mR_{V}\diag(\frac{-\left(2n^{2}+6n+3\right)\lambda_{V}^{n+2}+(n+2)^{2}\lambda_{V}^{n+1}+(n+1)^{2}\lambda_{V}^{n+3}-\lambda_{V}-1}{(\lambda_{V}-1)^{3}})\mL_{V}\mT_{:,k}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The most complex operation is the eigendecomposition which has to be done
 once for a fixed set of core sets.
 The rest is only matrix multiplications.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We presented a novel approach to estimate the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 of a projected Markov state model (PMM).
 The method has been demonstated at a simple illustrative model and shows
 much improved convergence in the estimation of the dominant timescales
 as well as related projected eigenvectors.
 Although the sensitivity to statistical noise has increased the method
 still provides better results compared to the MSM approach.
 The sensitivity can be reduced if the estimation is reformulated into an
 optimization problem that fits the result at more than two lagtimes.
 We have applied the optimizational approach to data from Apo-Myoglobin
 and showed a consistent set of two processes (maybe four).
 On first sight the estimation for 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMMs looks identical to and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-state HMM, but it can be shown that HMMs are not able to capture all possible
 dynamics of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-PMMs and HMMs can model a subset of the dynamics of PMMs.
 Thus the HMM solution might be close, but rarely exact

.
 Finally, the cases of low-statistics and non-reversible dynamics is interesting
 and subject of active research.
