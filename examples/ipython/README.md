## Python Notebook Examples
This folder contains some example python notebooks to learn and understand the ways OpenPathSampling works.

For this to work you need to have `ipython` and `ipython notebooks` installed. For help consult the 
[Installation Guide](http://ipython.org/install.html).

Then open a terminal, walk to this folder (in your local copy) and run 
```
ipython notebook
```
